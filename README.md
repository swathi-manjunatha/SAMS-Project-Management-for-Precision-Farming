The project demonstrated several key **project management skills**. The **planning phase** included defining clear objectives and creating a **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)** to organize tasks and ensure smooth execution. Financial management was crucial, with cost analysis, **ROI** calculation (222.08%), and a **payback period** of 2.16 years to track the project's profitability. 

Scheduling was efficiently handled through the creation of a **Gantt chart** to manage timelines and task dependencies. **Risk management** was addressed through a **SWOT analysis**, identifying potential risks and opportunities early on. 

A **communication plan** was developed to ensure consistent stakeholder engagement, using various channels for updates and feedback. Team coordination was facilitated with a **Responsibility Matrix**, ensuring roles were clearly assigned and accountability maintained. 

Throughout the project, progress was tracked by monitoring key performance indicators (**KPIs**), ensuring alignment with the project goals. Finally, **lessons learned** were documented to improve future project management practices, focusing on agile methodologies and integration planning.
